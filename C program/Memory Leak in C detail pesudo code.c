/* Memory Leak in c */
/* The memory leak occurs, when a piece of memory which was previously allocated by the programmer. 
    Then it is not deallocated properly by programmer.
   That memory is no longer in use by the program.
    So that place is reserved for no reason.
   Thatâ€™s why this is called the memory leak.*/
